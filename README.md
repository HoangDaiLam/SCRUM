### User story
factories, hospitals, housing everything within 1-2 kms
the schools, supermarkets, entertainments centers, Banks, Electricity center, sewage management.
wanted to make everything in 12 weeks - the length of the actual project.
User wants a database where any citizen can access any information and facilities
*The company is committed to sustainability. They wanted work and living environment to be as ecologically sustainable as possible. They believed that a green, self-sufficient community would not only attract employees but also ensure they stayed happy and healthy*

### Product Owner idea
- All in one Card: for everything that includes bank card, door key.
- Have a spare key <- some way to recover key
- Everything technologically enhanced
- School doors to car door everything accessed with one key
- Main server in the factory; middle of the civilization
- Server controls and stores every data including who has access to which part of the city
- Saves data mainly in cloud.
